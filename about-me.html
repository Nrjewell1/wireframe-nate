		<p>Hey everyone, my name is Nate Jewell, I graduated from the University of Virginia as a member of the Class of 2016. I still live in beautiful Charlottesville, VA working for UVA Finance. I was a member of Air Force ROTC in college and I am waiting to go Active Duty to Vance Air Force Base where I will engage in the USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training program.
		<br><br>
		I am a huge fan of music, particularly blues and classic rock.</p>
